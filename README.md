# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

<br>

This is the course project code for Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera).  The R script ```run_analysis.R``` does 
the following: 

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The end result is called ```tidy_final.txt```

<br>

**Note:** The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

```CodeBook.md``` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
